<h3 id="footwork">Footwork</h3>
<p>The first and must important part of achieving good climbing
technique is learning to use our feet effectively. We hear lots
of people saying certain climbers have good footwork, but what
does it actually mean?</p>
<p>In my opinion the two most important factors of good footwork are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Being able to place your feet quickly and precisely.</li>
<li>Being able to transfer your weight over your feet.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="be-quick-and-precise-">Be quick and precise:</h4>
<p>When we are placing our feet we should be aiming to use the front
of our rock boot as much as possible. This means the inside edge,
outside edge and the front point! This allows us to be precise
with our foot placements when standing on smaller holds, allows
us to twist and turn when climbing by simply pivoting on our
feet, and minimises the chance of our feet slipping off.  Using
this part of our feet also allows us to gain more force and
height from the foot placement. Think about how your foot works
when jumping, you flex your feet and push off from your toes. Its
the same principle when flexing your foot to stretch for a
distant climbing hold or flexing your foot when powering up for
that dyno! Obviously, we also have to learn when it is
appropriate to heel hook or toe hook (usually of very steep
ground), but the majority of foot placements should be made as
above.</p>
<h4 id="how-do-we-improve-this-">How do we improve this?</h4>
<p>It may sound simple, but looking at your feet when you place them
helps. Make a conscious effort to look at the foot hold, and
place your foot exactly where you are looking. If you are
clumping around with your feet, banging them off the wall each
time you place them or hoping about on a foot hold to readjust,
you are wasting valuable energy when you climb. The easiest way I
have found to practise this is to think really hard about it when
you are climbing easy warm up climbs, slow down and really
concentrate on placing your feet quietly in control. As you
improve at this, begin to attempt climbing these routes quicker,
but still be precise and controlled with your feet
placements. Over time this will improve your footwork on all of
your climbs. Another training tip I have for improving this is to
attempt climbing boulder problems in the arena using features
only for feet. This will help you learn how to trust standing on
small holds, it will help you improve your judgement with
foothold selection and it will also help build up core strength
as keeping your feet on small holds when climbing steeper
problems requires a lot of body tension!.</p>
<h4 id="transferring-your-weight-over-your-feet-">Transferring your weight over your feet:</h4>
<p>Spend time during your next session watching a really good
climber on a route up our main lead wall. As they move up the
wall you will see them transfer their body from side to side or
twist their whole body each time they reach for a hold! The
climber is doing this so that they can move their weight over the
foot that they are pushing off, thus moving in the most efficient
way. If your weight is over your foot when you push up on it, you
use far less pulling energy in your arms! A really good climber
to observe doing this is Nat Berry, as she is phenomenal at this
technique in climbing. Her amazing level of flexibility in her
hips, allows her to transfer her weight over any foothold
regardless of how awkwardly placed they are!</p>
<p>How do we improve this? This is a really important skill to
master, as the whole point of good technique is &#39;minimising the
amount of energy used in our arms&#39; ! The less energy we use in
our arms, the longer we can climb on a route before we get
tired. Learning to transfer our weight over our feet makes us
more efficient at how we use our feet and reduces the strain on
our arms, thus making us more technical climbers.  The best way I
have found to practise this technique is to spend time on the
&#39;Speed Wall&#39; slab area. Practice climbing the routes with one
hand, but really concentrate on getting the upward motion from
your legs!. If you have to pull with your hand to make a move,
stop and think about your feet and body position, then try
again. Once you have mastered this, make things harder for
yourself by attempting these climbs with no hands. You can place
your hands flat against the wall, but you are not allowed to
touch any of the holds. It is impossible to achieve this without
transferring your weight over your feet!</p>
<p>Finally start experimenting with how we can use twisting to help
us transfer our weight over our feet. Again use the &#39;Speed Wall&#39;
slab area. Force yourself to only use the outside edge of your
climbing shoe, in order to do this you will have to twist your
whole body round each time you stand up on a foot. An easy way to
think about it is to say to yourself - &#39;if I am standing up on my
right foot I have to twist to face left, if i am standing up on
my left foot I have to twist to face the right&#39;!</p>
<p>Spend a bit of time each session concentrating on practising good
footwork and you will become very good at using your
feet. Remember, there is more to being good at climbing than just
getting fitter and stronger! If we don&#39;t move well when we are
climbing we are not going to climb to our full potential!</p>
