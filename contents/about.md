All about everything
--------------------

You can use proprietary but free of charge Canon printers for either PIXUS 
860i or PIXUS iP4100 with this printer. You won't be able to print on CD's 
however. 
[Download the drivers from here: ](ftp://download.canon.jp/pub/driver/bj/linux/)

------------------------------

Gutenprint (gimp-print.sf.net) has an experimental driver for this 
model. You need to download and install the current CVS to get the driver.

------------------------------

I have made recent significant positive discoveries concerning the
useability of the PIXMA iP4000 Canon printer with one of the newest
distributions of Linux, Linux Mandrake v10.1, which was recently
renamed Linux Mandriva. I shall submit them in proper form to a Linux
user group forum to replace the current negative misinformation
circulating on the internet with my personal positive experimental
results.


As a courtesy, I am enclosing a summary of these discoveries to Canon
technical support at this time before submitting my findings to any
Linux user forums. I fully realize that what I am suggesting is a work
around which should only be used on an emergency basis until the
proper drivers have been meticulously designed and beta tested for
safe and effective use with a new printer such as mine.


1. By simply looking at a list of Canon Printers and the stated
properties of the ink tanks which they specify, I made the simple
discovery that I could select the Canon S500 printer in Linux Mandrake
v10.1's KDE hardware configuration daemon to properly drive the Canon
PIXMA iP4000 for all grayscale text printing from barely legible to
draft to normal quality at 600 dpi.


2. Similarly, I discovered that I could select the Canon S800 printer
in Linux Mandrake's KDE hardware configuration daemon to properly
drive the Canon PIXMA iP4000 in Linux Mandrake for all photographic
color applications, again from barely visible to extremely high
quality at 1200 dpi.


Please do not do as I did and dispair and complain about the lack of
support for new Canon hardware's use in Linux distributions to Canon
technical support before taking the time to consider the implications
of my personal discoveries concerning the state of hardware driver
availability in Linux.


Finally, I would submit for discussion that most modern distributions
of Linux would provide similar work arounds for most other new brands
of printers to those I found in Canon's case using KDE v3.2 to access
Linux Mandrake v10.1's hardware daemon. Finally, I must acknowledge
those persons whose contributions of working Linux hardware drivers
for Canon printers made my little work around a possibility in the
first
